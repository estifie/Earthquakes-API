The Earthquakes API is a RESTful API that provides information about earthquakes worldwide. It utilizes real-time earthquake data from various sources to provide accurate and up-to-date information. Earthquake data is retrieved from the USGS Earthquake and stored in a database for easy access.

## Installation

To install and run the Earthquakes API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axelnt/Earthquakes-API.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd Earthquakes-API
```

3. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

4. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

5. Start the API server

```bash
npm run start
```

## Data Sources

The Earthquakes API utilizes data from the following sources:

- USGS (United States Geological Survey): Provides real-time earthquake data worldwide. The API retrieves earthquake data from USGS and stores it in a database for easy access.

- Nominatim from OpenStreetMap: Provides location data for earthquake events. The API uses Nominatim to deliver accurate and detailed location information.

By combining data from USGS and Nominatim, the Earthquakes API offers comprehensive and up-to-date earthquake information with precise location details.

For more information about the data sources, you can visit the following websites:

- [USGS Earthquake Hazards Program](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards)
- [OpenStreetMap Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/)
